There are two ways to produce HTML block quotes in TiddlyWiki5, one for content spread across multiple lines, and one for single line content.

! Multi-line Block Quotes

The syntax for multi-line block quotes is:

<<wikitext-example src:"<<<
This is a block quoted paragraph
written in English
<<<
">>

!! Citation

A citation can be added to the quote like this:

<<wikitext-example src:"<<<
Computers are like a bicycle for our minds
<<< Steve Jobs
">>

!! CSS Classes

CSS classes can be added to a block quote:

<<wikitext-example src:"<<<.myClass.another-class
Operating systems are like a brick wall for our minds
<<< Nobody
">>

! Single-line Block Quotes

The single-line syntax for block quotes is actually an extension of the syntax for [[Lists in WikiText]]. For example:

<<wikitext-example src:"> Quoted text
> Another line of quoted text
">>

You can also nest quotes like this:

```
> A top quote
>> A subquote
> Another top quote
```

Which renders as:

> A top quote
>> A subquote
> Another top quote

You can also mix block quotes with other list items. For example:

<<wikitext-example src:"* List One
** List Two
**> A quote
**> Another quote
* List Three
">>
